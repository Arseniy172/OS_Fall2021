1) Increased Hit / Miss ratio

    Sequence: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 2 4 3 2 3 3 4 2 
    N = 2
    Number of hits = 14
    Number of misses = 9
    Hits / Misses = 1.55556

2) Decreased Hit/ Miss ratio

    Low hit / miss ratio:
    Sequence: 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1
    N = 3
    Number of hits = 5
    Number of misses = 14
    Hits / Misses = 0.357142

Explanation:

The aging algorithm works in a way that pages, which were used in last recent instructions will be used again. 
A high Hit / Miss ratio will happen when we will request same pages recently, as the aging algorithm will work. 
Otherwise, a low Hit / Miss ratio will happen when we will request different pages. Hence, we will meet same pages 
rarely.
