Recovery technique:

    This strategy is used when the system does not attempt to prevent deadlock from occuring. But it lets these deadlocks occur, 
    while trying to detect when this happens and then tries some options to recover after it. That is the main advantage in comparison
    with other two strategies.

Prevention technique:

    As a echnique of avoidence of deadlocks is practically impossible, as you have to know some information in advance, 
    a deadlock prevention strategy is the much more applicable one. If you will ensure that some of four conditions will not hold
    to create a deadlock, you will prevent it.

Avoidence technique:

    This strategy provides us with an ability to avoid deadlocks only if some qualified information is known in advance. That 
    particular strategy is pratically impossible to implement, as you cannot ensure that you will know some specifics about 
    some deadlocks in advance, which you have to know due to that strategy logic.
