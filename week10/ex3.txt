Explanation:
Each number we have to express as a binary number. More over,
for every user we will get permission bits in order: user, group, other.
Order of access bits: read, write, execute.

1) Case 600:
user can read and write, but cannot execute
group can read and write, but not execute
other can read, write and execute

2) Case 775
user can read, write and execute
group can read, write and execute
other can read and execute, but cannot write

3) Case 777
user can read, write and execute
group can read, write and execute
other can read, write and execute
