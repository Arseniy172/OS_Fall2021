Each page has size of 8KB (8192 bits = 2^13). So, the size of the offset of a virtual memory should be 13 bits.

As our machine has 16-bit virtual address, we can have 2^16 = 65536 addresses in a virtual memory.
So, 16-13 = 3 bits remain for addresses of single-level linear page table. It means that we can have 2^3 = 8 entries.

Answer: 8
